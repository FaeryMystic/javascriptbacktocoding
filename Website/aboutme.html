    <p class "bioabout"> I graduated from college a little over a year ago
      as of this writing. I feel like as most college graduates I wasn't ready
      to enter into my career. I wanted a little time to just enjoy life, and
      I have found that as a bartender, and now bar manager. I don't think it
      has been wasted, as I have learned to manage people, and my time, how to work
      hard, and I even work on my days off to make sure everything is finished on
      time.
      <br><br> I recently have rediscovered my love of code outside of school, and have
        begun working on several projects, which I will be linking to this website
        for you to peruse over the next year. Feel free to message me if you find
        anything interesting, I will have my contact information available on this
        website.
